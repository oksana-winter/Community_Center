Community_Center
A team-developed responsive web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The app features dynamic DOM manipulation to handle user interactions such as event listings, registration forms, and modals without page reloads. The project emphasizes modular JavaScript, event-driven architecture, and client-side validation. Version control was managed via GitHub for effective collaboration.
